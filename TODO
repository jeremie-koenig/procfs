* Fix the remaining quirks: owner of anonymous processes as INT_MAX (in
  libps?), start time.

* Try to limit dynamic (de)allocation in most cases while keeping the inner
  interface simple and sticking to correct read(dir) semantics. For instance
  add an (optional) "needed_length" field to procfs_node_ops, and arrange to
  pass a sufficent buffer in (*contents, *contents_len) when get_contents is
  called.

* Threads in /proc/[pid]/task/[n]: shouldn't be too hard, by reinstanciating
  "process" nodes for tasks, and providing an "exists" hook for the "task"
  entry itself so that it's disabled in threads. Might require support for
  missing libps flags, though.
